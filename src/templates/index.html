    <p><em>Editor’s note: This story was updated March 7, 2019, following the Mavericks’ 132-123 loss against the Washington Wizards. Luka Doncic scored 31 points to go along with 11 rebounds and seven assists. </em></p>
    <p>When it comes to Luka Doncic, there never was a doubt for the Dallas Mavericks.</p>
    <p>The team’s front office put in years of research and scouting on the Slovenian teenager before shipping Trae Young and a protected first-round pick in next year’s draft to Atlanta for Doncic in a <a href="https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-mavericks/mavericks/2018/06/29/mavericks-hawks-agree-deal-send-luka-doncic-dallas">draft-night trade</a>. Team owner Mark Cuban said getting Doncic in the draft was a <a href="https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-mavericks/mavericks/2018/12/15/no-brainer-luka-doncic-won-entire-mavericks-organization-long-before-drafted">"no-brainer,"</a> and ESPN analyst Mike Schmitz said Doncic was <a href="https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-mavericks/mavericks/2018/07/27/espn-analyst-mike-schmitz-says-mavs-got-nba-drafts-best-basketball-player-luka-doncic">"the best basketball player in the draft."</a></p>
    <p>Doncic has backed up the hype on the court. The 19-year-old phenom has planted his flag as the Mavericks' go-to option, leading the team in scoring and usage percentage.</p>
    <p>But is Doncic the NBA Rookie of the Year? A <em>Dallas Morning News</em> analysis used 10 different metrics to rate this season's rookie class, assigning each player two scores based on traditional and advanced statistics. <a href="#methodology">Read more</a> about how those scores are determined below. </p>
    <p>The result is clear. Doncic is the favorite. While Phoenix Suns big man Deandre Ayton ranks second to Doncic in both our traditional and advanced scores, Atlanta’s Young is Doncic’s only real competition for the award. Young has been electric since the All-Star break, increasing his points per game by more than 11 points, but ranks third behind Ayton in our traditional score and fifth in our advanced score.</p>
    <p>See how Doncic stacks up against the rest of the class below and why there’s no question he is the league’s rookie of the year.</p>


      <p class="subhead">Putting up the numbers</p>
      <p>Doncic has no trouble filling up a box score. He leads this rookie class in scoring at <span class="smart-text__ppg" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span> points per game and ranks in the top three in per-game averages for rebounds (<span class="smart-text__rbg" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span>) and assists (<span class="smart-text__apg" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span>) and steals (<span class="smart-text__spg" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span>).</p>
      <p>Those numbers are impressive when compared to his fellow rookies, but historically, they are off the charts. In the history of the NBA, only two other rookies have averaged 20 points, six rebounds and five assists per game: Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan.</p>
      <p>Beyond the traditional stats, Doncic’s performance across a range of advanced NBA metrics puts him at the front of this year’s class as well. While Doncic and Young rank one-two in <span class="highlight" data-term="usage">usage percentage</span>, Doncic has outshined Young this year in  <span class="highlight" data-term="winshares">winshares</span> and <span class="highlight" data-term="bpm">box plus/minus</span>.</p>
      <p>Doncic’s <span class="smart-text__ws" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span> winshares this season is second only to Ayton’s, while Young’s <span class="smart-text__ws" data-player="Trae Young"></span> winshares is about average for this rookie class.</p>
      <p>While Doncic and Young are near equals in how often they are on the court and how much of the offense flows through them, Doncic’s advantage in winshares and box plus-minus give him a significant advantage in our advanced metric score. </p>

    <p class="subhead">Recent history is on his side</p>
    <p>If Doncic finishes the season where he is now, leading all rookies in our traditional and advanced metric scores, he’ll be the seventh rookie since 2008-09 to do so. The other six all won NBA Rookie of the Year. Three of the remaining four rookie of the year winners finished first in at least one of our metric scores.</p>
    <p>Currently, Doncic leads Ayton by <span class="difference-text__total_stand_zscore" data-player1="Luka Doncic" data-player2="Deandre Ayton"></span> in our traditional metrics score and <span class="difference-text__total_adv_zscore" data-player1="Luka Doncic" data-player2="Deandre Ayton"></span> in our advanced metrics score. </p>
    <p>In the past 10 years, only Andrew Wiggins (2014-15) took home the best rookie award while not finishing first in either metric. The Timberwolves forward set himself apart in points per game, though. Wiggins averaged 5.0 points more than the Los Angeles Lakers’ Jordan Clarkson and 6.7 more than rookie of the year runner-up Nikola Mirotic.</p>
    <p>Doncic, who leads the rookie class in scoring, is averaging 2.8 more points per game than Young, the next highest scoring rookie.</p>

    {%include "adblock2.html" %}


    <p class="subhead">Best in a decade?</p>
    <p>As previously stated, Doncic is having a statistical rookie campaign for the ages, placing him in some elite company when it comes to points, rebounds and assists.</p>
    <p>Given that, it’s no surprise Doncic also sets himself apart when compared to the other <span class="rookie_count"></span> rookies since the 2008-09 season. As of now, Doncic’s traditional and advanced metric scores rank most closely with the rookie years of Kyrie Irving and Tyreke Evans, both rookie of the year winners.</p>
    <p>Given Doncic’s success thus far, along with the rebuilt roster following midseason trades that have put even more of the offensive burden on Doncic, Doncic should be a lock to finish in the top five in combined traditional and advanced scores. </p>
    <p>As it is, Doncic ranks fourth out of the <span class="rookie_count"></span> rookies since 2008-09 in our analysis’ advanced metrics score and seventh in our traditional metrics score. When it comes to points per game alone, Doncic’s <span class="smart-text__ppg" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span> is second only to Blake Griffin’s 22.5.</p>

    <div id="all-roty" class="chart">
      <div class="chatter">
        <h5>Doncic's place in the last 10 years</h5>
        <p>Comparing Luka Doncic to every rookie in the last 10 years, not just his class, in our two metric scores gives a better understanding of the historical significance of his first season. Note: Doncic's scores here will differ from those above, where he was rated against only his rookie class, not the <span class="rookie_count"></span> rookies since the 2008 draft.</p>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="all-roty__graphic" class="inline-block chart__container"></div>
      <p class="source"><strong>Source: </strong>DMN analysis and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/" target="_blank">Basketball Reference</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> Excluding Kyrie Irving, only rookies who qualify for the NBA’s points per game leaderboard shown. Irving won rookie of the year in 2012 despite only playing 51 games.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="subhead">What about Young?</p>
    <p>Doncic’s successes on the court and the hype surrounding his rookie campaign may lead to him running away with the rookie of the year voting. But a second-half explosion by Young has the Atlanta guard entering the conversation.</p>
    <p>Young’s dominance in the passing game (<span class="smart-text__apg" data-player="Trae Young"></span> assists per game) and scoring output (<span class="smart-text__ppg" data-player="Trae Young"></span> points per game) push him into the third spot in our traditional metrics score. And despite rating below average in winshares and box plus-minus, he’s still fifth in our advanced score.</p>
    <p>What might ultimately keep Young from making this a closer race is his first half. Young averaged 16.9 points per game, along with 3.3 rebounds, 7.6 assists and shot 40.8 percent from the field before the All-Star break. Since then, he leads all rookies in points per game (28.5), and has upped his rebounds (4.1) and assists (8.6), while improving his shooting to 45.3 percent. </p>
    <p>But Doncic has had a tremendous amound of hype all season, and he’s shown why with his clutch play. The 19-year-old Mavericks rookie has made plenty of highlight reels, including his <a href="https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-mavericks/mavericks/2018/12/09/nba-king-texas-moment-mavericks" target="_blank">11-0 scoring run</a> over the final two minutes to lift Dallas to a victory over Houston in December. That’s just one instance of the 11 times Doncic has hit a field goal to tie or take the lead in a game in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime, second most in the league behind Chicago’s Zach LaVine.</p>
    <p>The oddsmakers believe Doncic is almost as sure a bet as you could make, too. The DraftKings Sportsbook lists Doncic as -10,000 to win the award, meaning a bet of $10,000 would pay back only $100 if Doncic wins the Rookie of the Year.</p>
    <p>In a season that is sure to be the last for Dirk Nowitzki, the face of the franchise, and the Mavericks’ fleecing of the Knicks, by all accounts, in a trade for Kristaps Porzingis, Doncic’s rookie year has never stopped being the story. Don’t expect that to change when the league hands out its hardware for best rookie.</p>

    <p class="subhead" id="methodology">How we scored the rookies</p>
    <div class="meth__block">
      <p>Each player in this season’s rookie class was rated against one another in 10 statistical categories. Our traditional score uses per game numbers for points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. The advanced score is composed of minutes per game, <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html" target="_blank">winshares</a>, <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm.html" target="_blank">box plus/minus</a>, <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/per.html" target="_blank">player efficiency rating</a> and <a href="https://www.nbastuffer.com/analytics101/usage-rate/" target="_blank">usage percentage</a>.</p>
      <p>While minutes per game is a traditional statistic, it's included with the advanced metrics intentionally. Usage percentage measures only the percentage of plays used by a player while he is on the floor. The more a player is on the floor, the more impact his usage percentage has, and typically, a player‘s efficiency decreases as usage increases. Players that can maintain efficiency at high usage rates over increased playing time are more valuable to their team.</p>
      <p>To generate a player's total score, players were assigned a <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/probability-and-statistics/z-score/" target="_blank">z-score</a> for each stat. The z-score measures not just where a player ranks among a group, but how much better — or worse — that player is versus the group’s average in that statistic. Those scores are  combined to calculate our total metric scores. In short, the better each player is than the average player in a statistic, the higher their total score.</p>
      <p><strong>For example:</strong> Luka Doncic’s total traditional score of <span class="smart-text__total_stand" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span> is calculated by adding his z-scores for per-game averages of points, rebound, assists, steals and blocks (<span class="smart-text__z-ppg" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span> + <span class="smart-text__z-rpg" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span> + <span class="smart-text__z-apg" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span> + <span class="smart-text__z-spg" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span> + <span class="smart-text__z-bpg" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span> = <span class="smart-text__total_stand" data-player="Luka Doncic"></span>).</p>
